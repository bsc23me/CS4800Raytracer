# CS4800Raytracer
This is a project that I worked on for my undergraduate Computer Graphics class. I implemented a basic ray tracer in Unity which can draw triangulated mesh .obj files with textures in a scene. The light simulated in the environment bounces off of multiple surfaces and is cast for each pixel on screen.
